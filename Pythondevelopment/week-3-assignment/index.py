# Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after
#  applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage 
# (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, 
# return the original price.
# Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount 
# percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original 
# price.


def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        return price

original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percentage = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percentage)
print("Final price after applying the discount:", final_price)
